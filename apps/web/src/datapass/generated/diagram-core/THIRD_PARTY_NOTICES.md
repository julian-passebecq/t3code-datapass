# Third-party notices

The root MIT license covers original DiagramCloud code. It does not relicense dependency code, provider trademarks, third-party artwork, fonts, user uploads or source portfolio documents. Retain upstream copyright and license notices when redistributing the built editor.

## Runtime dependencies

React and React DOM, Microsoft Fluent UI React components, React Flow (`@xyflow/react`), Zod, zod-to-json-schema and PptxGenJS are distributed under their upstream MIT licenses. DOMPurify offers MPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0; this application uses the Apache-2.0 option. Build/test tools and transitive packages have their own terms. The generated `public/third-party-licenses.txt` inventories installed package versions and copies their available license/notice files; it is included in `dist/`. This is an attribution aid, not a legal compliance certification.

## Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse artwork

File: `public/icons/fabric-lakehouse.svg`.

Source package path: `FabricTools/fabric-icons/node_modules/@fabric-msft/svg-icons/svg/lakehouse_48_item.svg`.

Package: `@fabric-msft/svg-icons` 8.2.0. Repository commit: `e206270f367dc440b5bf6bc94f0f6267b922d596` (last change to this file, 2026-05-19).

Git blob: `a06e893bb2ecafcc6a563a607e7b4c2064b7a7d9`. The shipped file is byte-identical to the upstream file; the build recomputes this blob and fails if the file is changed. (An earlier version of this notice recorded `a06e6f9b…`, which was a transcription error; the upstream and committed blobs are both `a06e893b…`.)

Source: https://github.com/FabricTools/fabric-icons/blob/e206270f367dc440b5bf6bc94f0f6267b922d596/node_modules/@fabric-msft/svg-icons/svg/lakehouse_48_item.svg

The source repository's MIT licence covers that repository's own code, not Microsoft's artwork.

The artwork is Microsoft product iconography, not DiagramCloud artwork and not offered under this repository's MIT license. It is used to identify a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse in architecture/educational diagrams. The Microsoft usage rules permit specified diagram/training/documentation uses and prohibit cropping, flipping, rotating or distorting the icons or using them as one's own product logo. Preserve the original artwork and label the represented Microsoft item.

## Microsoft Fabric Pipeline artwork

File: `public/icons/fabric-pipeline.svg`.

Source package path: `FabricTools/fabric-icons/node_modules/@fabric-msft/svg-icons/svg/pipeline_48_item.svg`.

Package: `@fabric-msft/svg-icons` 8.2.0. Repository commit: `e206270f367dc440b5bf6bc94f0f6267b922d596` (last change to this file, 2026-05-19).

Git blob: `fb8b9c4db4b97a4346f56c6fb7ed1228550419db`. The shipped file is byte-identical to the upstream file, fetched by that blob ID; the build recomputes this blob and fails if the file is changed.

Source: https://github.com/FabricTools/fabric-icons/blob/e206270f367dc440b5bf6bc94f0f6267b922d596/node_modules/@fabric-msft/svg-icons/svg/pipeline_48_item.svg

The source repository's MIT licence covers that repository's own code, not Microsoft's artwork. The same Microsoft usage rules as for the Lakehouse artwork apply: it identifies the Fabric Data Factory pipeline item in the Microsoft Fabric sample ("Data Factory pipeline" box) and is shown unmodified and labelled.

## Further Microsoft Fabric item artwork (1.0)

Same source repository, package (`@fabric-msft/svg-icons` 8.2.0), commit `e206270f367dc440b5bf6bc94f0f6267b922d596` and Microsoft usage terms (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/icons) as the Lakehouse and Pipeline artwork above. Each file is byte-identical to upstream; the build recomputes the git blob. The Lakehouse artwork is also used for the Fabric sample's Silver layer, following Microsoft's lakehouse-per-layer medallion guidance.

| File | Upstream file | Represents | Git blob | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `public/icons/fabric-data-warehouse.svg` | `data_warehouse_48_item.svg` | Microsoft Fabric Warehouse item | `624222e8fad1dfb1285aab130884645895d22aad` | Available to authors; not used by a sample. |
| `public/icons/fabric-notebook.svg` | `notebook_48_item.svg` | Microsoft Fabric Notebook item | `f329876b4e02ccabd1b2cdc01d26102f008c47c0` | Available to authors; not used by a sample. |
| `public/icons/fabric-semantic-model.svg` | `semantic_model_48_item.svg` | Microsoft Fabric Semantic model item | `8fe5fc93fe7d6f536629b5e5ba0d5f314a7bc516` | Microsoft Fabric sample, "Semantic model + Power BI" box. |
| `public/icons/fabric-sql-database.svg` | `sql_database_48_item.svg` | Microsoft Fabric SQL database item | `04e1ead5f1239138b4c19dcb89423597012afb3a` | Available to authors; not used by a sample. |
| `public/icons/fabric-eventstream.svg` | `eventstream_48_item.svg` | Microsoft Fabric Eventstream item | `bfe104a0ec081b3c3f7db5bbab56959d18632905` | DataPass architecture sample, "Eventstream ingestion" box. |
| `public/icons/fabric-kql-database.svg` | `kql_database_48_item.svg` | Microsoft Fabric KQL database item | `894da8130df7afc8f5fa977be04721ae1945a3cd` | DataPass architecture sample, "Eventhouse / KQL" box. |

Azure and Databricks artwork is not bundled: Azure icons are a separate download with their own terms and Databricks publishes no icon usage terms, so those concepts use original generic symbols.

The icon registry in `src/core/icons.ts` is the source of truth for every icon ID: a vendor icon is drawn only if it is registered with its source, version, blob and terms, and `scripts/icons.ts` fails the build for an unregistered or modified file in `public/icons`. Other symbols in `src/ui/Canvas.tsx` are original generic component symbols, not representations claimed to be official vendor logos. The activity animation surrounds the icon; it does not rotate the Microsoft artwork.

## diagram-design (visual grammar of Diagram Design mode, 1.12)

Diagram Design mode (`src/export/design/`) and the design brief adapt the visual grammar of **diagram-design** by Cathryn Lavery: semantic colour roles and their light/dark values, rectangular type tags, rounded right-angle connectors (r = 8) with masked uppercase labels, fanned attach points, zones, the bottom legend strip, the accessible SVG contract, the layer-stack and exploded-axonometric conventions, and its figure-selection guidance. DiagramCloud's renderers are an independent TypeScript implementation that draws from the DiagramCloud model; no diagram-design code, templates, icons or fonts are copied. Instrument Serif, Geist and Geist Mono are only named in font stacks with system fallbacks: no font files are shipped and nothing is fetched. The Tabler, Simple Icons, log-z and Devicon artwork bundled with diagram-design is not used.

Upstream: https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design at commit `d1376371965f513d99cc9ec388835d255c5c88d5` (skill v2.6, read 2026-10-07).

## Fonts and portfolio content

No font binaries are distributed. The UI uses installed system fonts; exported PowerPoint refers to fonts installed on the reader's machine and may substitute them. No font files may be added to an output archive without independently verified redistribution rights.

The portfolio sample descriptions derive from user-supplied PDFs. Raw PDFs and personal contact details were not added to this repository. Newly authored code, tables and financial illustrations carry explicit provenance labels and are not asserted to be confidential production data or verified employer outcomes. User-uploaded images remain subject to the uploader's rights and permissions.


## Google Identity Services / Google Picker / Google Drive API

DiagramCloud can optionally load Google-hosted Identity Services and Google Picker JavaScript at runtime and call Google Drive API endpoints after explicit user authorization. These Google services are not vendored into this MIT repository and are governed by Google's applicable API/service terms. DiagramCloud requests the per-file `drive.file` scope and keeps OAuth access tokens in browser memory only.
